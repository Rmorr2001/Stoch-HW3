    Implementation Details:
    
    A. Master Problem (master_problem.py)
    -------------------------------------
    1. Initial formulation:
       min 100x1 + 150x2 + θ
       s.t. x1 + x2 ≤ 120
            x1 ≥ 40
            x2 ≥ 20
    
    2. As iterations progress, optimality cuts are added:
       min 100x1 + 150x2 + θ
       s.t. x1 + x2 ≤ 120
            x1 ≥ 40
            x2 ≥ 20
            E₁x₁ + E₂x₂ + θ ≥ e   (optimality cuts)
    
    B. Subproblems (subproblems.py)
    -------------------------------
    1. For each scenario k, solve:
       min q₁y₁ + q₂y₂
       s.t. 6y₁ + 10y₂ ≤ 60x₁
            8y₁ + 5y₂ ≤ 80x₂
            y₁ ≤ d₁
            y₂ ≤ d₂
            y₁, y₂ ≥ 0
    
    2. The right-hand sides depend on the current x values:
       - For constraints: h = Tx
       - For scenario 1: d₁ = 500, d₂ = 100
       - For scenario 2: d₁ = 300, d₂ = 300
    
    C. Dual Value Processing (Key Challenge)
    ---------------------------------------
    1. Raw dual values from the solver have this structure:
       [constraint_dual_1, constraint_dual_2, lb_dual_1, lb_dual_2, ub_dual_1, ub_dual_2]
    
    2. For the L-shaped method, we need them in this format:
       [constraint_dual_1, constraint_dual_2, ub_dual_1 (negated), ub_dual_2 (negated)]
    
    3. The transformation function handles this generically:
       - Copies constraint duals directly
       - For variables at their upper bounds, finds their corresponding dual values
       - Applies the correct sign (negative for upper bound duals)
    
    D. Optimality Cut Generation
    ---------------------------
    1. For each scenario k with probability p_k:
       - Calculate eₖ = p_k * π_k^T * h_k
       - Calculate E_k = p_k * π_k^T * T_k
    
    2. Total cut components:
       - e = Σ(eₖ)
       - E = Σ(E_k)
    
    3. Add the cut E*x + θ ≥ e to the master problem

    Dual Value Transformation Details:
    =================================
    
    The most challenging aspect of implementing the L-shaped method is correctly
    extracting and transforming dual values from the LP solver.
    
    1. Raw Dual Structure:
       - When we solve an LP with constraints and variable bounds, the solver
         returns dual values for both constraints and bounds.
       - For example, with 2 constraints and 2 variables, we might get:
         [constraint1_dual, constraint2_dual, y1_lb_dual, y2_lb_dual, y1_ub_dual, y2_ub_dual]
    
    2. Required Dual Structure for L-shaped Method:
       - The L-shaped method requires a specific format for dual values:
         [constraint1_dual, constraint2_dual, y1_ub_dual, y2_ub_dual]
       - Note that lower bound duals are omitted, and upper bound duals need a specific sign.
    
    3. Transformation Logic:
       - Copy constraint duals directly (first part of the vector)
       - Identify which variables are at their upper bounds
       - For each such variable, find the corresponding non-zero dual value
       - Properly assign this value (with correct sign) to the right position
    
    4. Sign Conventions:
       - In the dual vector for the L-shaped method, upper bound duals typically
         have a negative sign relative to the raw values from the solver.
       - This is why we negate the upper bound dual values during transformation.
    
    5. Example Scenario 2, Iteration 2:
       - Raw vector: [-3.2, 0.0, 0, 8.8, 0, 0]
       - Variable y1 is at its upper bound (300)
       - The value 8.8 corresponds to y1's upper bound dual
       - Transformed vector: [-3.2, 0.0, -8.8, 0]
       
    This generic approach handles the dual transformation without requiring
    special case logic for specific scenarios or iterations.

    print("""
    Optimality Cut Calculation:
    =========================
    
    Each optimality cut has the form: Ex + θ ≥ e
    
    The components are calculated as follows:
    
    1. For each scenario k with probability p_k:
       - π_k = dual values for scenario k subproblem
       - h_k = right-hand side constants vector
       - T_k = technology matrix (relating x to the RHS)
    
    2. Calculate individual components:
       - e_k = p_k * π_k^T * h_k
       - E_k = p_k * π_k^T * T_k
    
    3. Sum up across all scenarios:
       - e = ∑ e_k
       - E = ∑ E_k
    
    4. Calculate w (actual recourse function value):
       - w = e - E*x
    
    5. Check convergence:
       - If |w - θ| ≤ tolerance, stop
       - Otherwise, add the cut Ex + θ ≥ e and continue

    Implementation Insights and Challenges:
    =====================================
    
    1. Dual Value Extraction:
       - Different solvers may return dual information in different formats.
       - GLPK (used in this implementation) requires careful extraction of duals
         for both constraints and variable bounds.
       - The raw dual vector needs interpretation to correctly identify which values
         correspond to which constraints and bounds.
    
    2. Numerical Stability:
       - Small numerical differences can affect the convergence behavior.
       - Using a sufficient tolerance (e.g., 1e-6) helps prevent premature or
         delayed convergence.
    
    3. Variable Bounds:
       - Upper bound duals play a crucial role in the optimality cuts.
       - Correctly identifying binding upper bounds and their associated dual values
         is essential for accurately calculating the E and e components.
    
    4. Cut Generation:
       - Each iteration adds one new cut to the master problem.
       - These cuts progressively improve the approximation of the recourse function.
       - The algorithm converges when the approximation (θ) is sufficiently close to
         the actual value (w).
    
    5. General Approach vs. Special Cases:
       - Our implementation uses a generic approach without special case handling.
       - This promotes better understanding of the algorithm and more reliable behavior
         across different problem instances.
    
    6. Scenario Contributions:
       - Each scenario contributes to the optimality cut based on its probability and
         dual solution.
       - The total cut components are the probability-weighted sum across all scenarios.

    - Cut: 83.52x₁ + 180.48x₂ + θ ≥ -520

    Iteration 3:
    - x ≈ (67, 53), θ ≈ -15698
    - New cut added
    - Gap continues to reduce
    
    Iterations continue until the gap |w - θ| is less than the tolerance.

    of approximately -10960.
